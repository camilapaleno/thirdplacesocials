                    What is a third place?
                </h4>
                <h1>
                    Ray Oldenburg, an American urban sociologist and author of The Great Good Place, coined the term “third place”
                </h1>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Ray Oldenburg’s Third Place Theory centers on the idea that our lives can be divided into three primary realms: the first place, the second place, and the third place.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>The First Place: Home</h4>
                        <p>The first place is where people reside and build their personal lives.
                            <br>
                            It is often characterized by privacy, solitude, and a sense of ownership.
                            <br>
                            Home is essential for providing stability, comfort, and personal identity.

                        <h4>The Second Place: Work</h4>
                        <p>The second place represents the workplace, where individuals spend a significant portion of their time.
                            <br>
                            It is associated with productivity, professional roles, and often demands a structured environment.
                            <Br>
                            Workplaces are crucial for economic stability and career development.

                        <p>The third place includes settings like cafes, bookstores, parks, community centers, and other public spaces.
                            <br>
                            The third place encourages social interaction, conversation, and community bonding.
